        description={`OT Security Services are specialized cybersecurity solutions designed to protect Operational Technology (OT) environments. OT systems are used to control physical operations such as manufacturing, energy distribution, water treatment, and transportation. These environments often include legacy systems and proprietary protocols that were not meant for security, making them vulnerable to cyber threats.

        These services typically include risk assessments, network segmentation, continuous threat detection, incident response, and continuous monitoring tailored specifically for OT environments. Unlike IT environments, OT security measures prioritize operational continuity and safety above data protection.`}
