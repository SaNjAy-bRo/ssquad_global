Threat intelligence is the process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information on existing cyber threats. It helps organizations understand threat actors, their tactics, and potential attack vectors.
        
        By using this intelligence, businesses can proactively defend against cyberattacks, improve their security posture, and respond faster to incidents. It's like having a radar that detects danger before it hits, enabling smarter, more informed cybersecurity decisions.`}
